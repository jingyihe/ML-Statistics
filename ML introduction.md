ML implementation: 1. NLP, 2. Image, 3. forcasting 



ML: data—> model —> prediction

ML algorithm: 

1. supervised learning(classification; regression; ) & unsupervised learning(clustering)
2.  supervised learning: KNN, naive baysian, decision tree and logistic regression for classification, linear regression & ridge regression for regression
3. unsupervised learning: k-means

Pipeline: data —> clean data —> feature engineer —> modeling —> metrics — > online/offline —> production



feature engineering :

	1.  dataset
 	2.  feature extraction
 	3.  clean dataset/missing
 	4.  dimension reduction

1. clean data, missing value, Feature extraction,
